	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>This is an example page that demonstrates the use of HTML headings.</p>
	
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>HTML headings are useful for structuring content and creating a hierarchy of information on a web page.</p>
	
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>There are six levels of HTML headings, ranging from h1 (most important) to h2 (least important).</p>
	
	<h3>Data Collection</h3>
	<p>In this example, we collected data by creating a simple HTML page and using it to test our program.</p>
	
	<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
	<p>We used Python to parse the HTML page and extract information about the headings and their content.</p>
	
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Our program successfully parsed the HTML page and produced an index of the headings and their content.</p>
